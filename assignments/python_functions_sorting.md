# More Python Basics - Functions and Sorting

## Goals

* Learn how Python functions can help us write more readable,  reliable and re-usable code.
* Learn basic sorting in Python.

## Python reading and practice

* Read up on [sorting](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html) through [Ascending and Descending](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#ascending-and-descending)
* Functions:
  * [Art of Writing Functions](/docs/python/art_of_functions.md)
  * [W3Schools Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)
  * [Chapter 3 - Functions](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter3/) of *Automate the Boring Stuff*. As always, no need to do exercises. Just work through code examples to begin familiarizing yourself with the basics of Python functions.
